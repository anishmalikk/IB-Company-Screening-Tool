CREDIT FACILITIES SECTION (KEY REVOLVER/TERM LOAN INFO):

Credit Facilities”).
As of March 31, 2025, there were
no
outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.
The commitment fee based on the amount of unused commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility was $
0.5
million in each of the three months ended March 31, 2025, and 2024. As of March 31, 2025, we had issued letters of credit totaling approximately $
5.2
million against the letter of credit facility sublimit under the Revolving Credit Facility.
Standalone Letter of Credit Facilities
As of March 31, 2025, we had issued letters of credit totaling approximately $
64.7
million under our aggregate $
81.0
million standalone letter of credit facilities. The total fees under the letter of credit facilities were immaterial in each of the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024.
Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility
As of March 31, 2025, we have a $
150.0
million revolving accounts receivable securitization facility (the “AR Facility”), which terminates in June 2027, unless further extended.
In connection with the AR Facility, Outfront Media LLC and Outfront Media Outernet Inc., each a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and certain of the Company’s taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRSs”) (the “Originators”), will sell and/or contribute their respective existing and future accounts receivable and certain related assets to either Outfront Media Receivables LLC, a special purpose vehicle and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company relating to the Company’s qualified REIT subsidiary accounts receivable assets (the “QRS SPV”) or Outfront Media Receivables TRS, LLC a special purpose vehicle and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company relating to the Company’s TRS accounts receivable assets (the “TRS SPV” and together with the QRS SPV, the “SPVs”). The SPVs may transfer undivided interests in their respective accounts receivable assets to certain purchasers from time to time (the “Purchasers”). The SPVs are separate legal entities with their own separate creditors who will be entitled to access the SPVs’ assets before the assets become available to the Company. Accordingly, the SPVs’ assets are not available to pay creditors of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, although collections from the receivables in excess of amounts required to repay the Purchasers and other creditors of the SPVs may be remitted to the Company. Outfront Media LLC will service the accounts receivables on behalf of the SPVs for a fee. The Company has agreed to guarantee the performance of the Originators and Outfront Media LLC, in its capacity as servicer, of their respective obligations under the agreements governing the AR Facility. Neither the Company, the Originators nor the SPVs guarantee the collectability of the receivables under the AR Facility. Further, the TRS SPV and the QRS SPV are jointly and severally liable for their respective obligations under the agreements governing the AR Facility.
As of March 31, 2025, there were $
50.0
million of outstanding borrowings under the AR Facility, at a borrowing rate of
5.6
%. As of March 31, 2025, borrowing capacity remaining under the AR Facility was $
100.0
million based on approximately $
312.9
million of accounts receivable that could be used as collateral for the AR Facility in accordance with the agreements governing the AR Facility. The commitment fee based on the amount of unused commitments under the AR Facility was $
0.1
million in each of the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024. In April 2025, we made a repayment of $
10.0
million under the AR Facility.
Debt Covenants
Our credit agreement, dated as of January 31, 2014 (as amended, restated, amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise modified, the “Credit Agreement”), governing the Senior Credit Facilities, the agreements governing the AR Facility, and the indentures governing our senior notes contain customary affirmative and negative covenants, subject to certain exceptions,

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(Unaudited)
including but not limited to those that restrict the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ abilities to (i) pay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect to the Company’s or its wholly-owned subsidiary, Outfront Media Capital LLC’s capital stock or make other restricted payments other than dividends or distributions necessary for us to maintain our REIT status, subject to certain conditions and exceptions, (ii) enter into agreements restricting certain subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany or third-party transfers, and (iii) incur additional indebtedness. One of the exceptions to the restriction on our ability to incur additional indebtedness is satisfaction of a Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio, which is the ratio of our consolidated total debt to our Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) for the trailing four consecutive quarters, of no greater than
6.0
to 1.0. As of March 3

We continually project anticipated cash requirements for our operating, investing and financing needs as well as cash flows generated from operating activities available to meet these needs. Due to seasonal advertising patterns and influences on advertising markets, our revenues and operating income are typically highest in the fourth quarter, during the holiday shopping season, and lowest in the first quarter, as advertisers adjust their spending following the holiday shopping season. Further, certain of our municipal transit contracts require guaranteed minimum annual payments to be paid on a monthly or quarterly basis, as applicable.
Our short-term cash requirements primarily include payments for operating leases, guaranteed minimum annual payments, interest, capital expenditures, equipment deployment costs and dividends. Funding for short-term cash needs will come primarily from our cash on hand, operating cash flows, our ability to issue debt and equity securities, and borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below), the AR Facility (as defined below) or other credit facilities that we may establish, to the extent available.
In addition, as part of our growth strategy, we frequently evaluate strategic opportunities to acquire new businesses, assets or digital technology, directly or in connection with joint ventures (including buy/sell arrangements with joint venture partners). Consistent with this strategy, we regularly evaluate potential acquisitions, ranging from small transactions to larger acquisitions, which transactions and transaction-related expenses will be funded through cash on hand, additional borrowings, equity or other securities, or some combination thereof.
Our long-term cash needs include principal payments on outstanding indebtedness and commitments related to operating leases and franchise and other agreements, including any related guaranteed minimum annual payments, and equipment deployment costs. Funding for long-term cash needs will come from our cash on hand, operating cash flows, our ability to issue debt and equity securities, and borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility or other credit facilities that we may establish, to the extent available.
Although we have taken several actions to date to enhance our financial flexibility and increase our liquidity, our short-term and long-term cash needs and related funding capability may be adversely affected if cash on hand and operating cash flows decrease in 2025, and our ability to issue debt and equity securities and/or borrow under our existing or new credit facilities on reasonable pricing terms, or at all, may become uncertain. (See the “Overview” section of this MD&A.)

Working capital was a deficit of $208.5 million as of March 31, 2025, compared to a deficit of $135.0 million as of December 31, 2024, primarily driven by lower receivables, higher borrowings under the AR Facility, lower accrued lease and franchise costs, and lower bonus accruals.
Under the current MTA agreement, which was amended in June 2020 and July 2021 and is subject to modification as agreed-upon by us and the MTA (as amended, the “MTA Agreement”):
•
Deployments
. We must deploy, over a number of years, (i) 5,433 digital advertising screens on subway and train platforms and entrances, (ii) 15,896 smaller-format digital advertising screens on rolling stock, and (iii) 9,283  MTA communications displays, which amounts are subject to the MTA’s ability to fulfill its pre-installation obligations under the MTA Agreement. We are also obligated to deploy certain additional digital advertising screens and MTA communications displays in subway and train stations and rolling stock that the MTA may build or acquire in the future (collectively, the “New Inventory”).
•
Recoupment of Equipment Deployment Costs.
We may retain incremental revenues that exceed an annual base revenue amount for the cost of deploying advertising and communications displays throughout the transit system. Recoupable MTA equipment deployment costs are recorded as
Prepaid MTA equipment deployment costs
and
Intangible assets
on our Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, and as these costs are recouped from incremental revenues that the MTA would otherwise be entitled to receive,
Prepaid MTA equipment deployment costs
will be reduced. If incremental revenues generated over the term of the agreement are not sufficient to cover all or a portion of the equipment deployment costs, the costs will not be recouped, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including impairment charges (see Note 4.
Intangible
Assets
to the Consolidated Financial Statements). If we do not recoup all costs of deploying advertising and communications screens with respect to the New Inventory by the end of the term of the MTA Agreement, the MTA will be obligated to reimburse us for these costs. Deployment costs in an amount not to exceed $50.7 million, which are deemed authorized before December 31, 2020, will be paid directly by the MTA. For any deployment costs deemed authorized after December 31, 2020, the MTA and the Company will no longer be obligated to directly pay 70% and 30% of the costs, respectively, and these costs will be subject to recoupment in accordance with the MTA Agreement. We did not recoup any equipment deployment costs in the three months ended March 31, 2025. In addition, we currently do not expect to recoup any equipment deployment costs throughout the remainder of the Amended Term (as defined below) of the MTA Agreement. We expect our MTA equipment deployment costs to be approximately $35.0 million in 2025. We expect MTA equipment deployment costs to be approximately $30.0 million to $40.0 million annually throughout the remainder of the Amended Term (as defined below) of the MTA Agreement and encompass replacement costs. Accordingly, we expect annual MTA equipment deployment costs will decline now that we have substantially completed our initial deployment during 2024.
•
Payments
. We must pay to the MTA the greater of a percentage of revenues or a guaranteed minimum annual payment. Our payment obligations with respect to guaranteed minimum annual payment amounts owed to the MTA resumed on January 1, 2021, in accordance with the terms of the MTA Agreement, and any guaranteed minimum annual payment amounts that would have been paid for the period from April 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020 (less any revenue share amounts actually paid during this period using an increased revenue share percentage of 65%) will instead be added in equal increments to the guaranteed minimum annual payment amounts owed for the period from January 1, 2022, through December 31, 2026. The MTA Agreement also provides that if prior to April 1, 2028 the balance of unrecovered costs of deploying advertising and communications screens throughout the transit system is equal to or less than zero, then in any year following the year in which such recoupment occurs (the “Recoupment Year”), the MTA is entitled to receive an additional payment equal to 2.5% of the annual base revenue amount for such year calculated in accordance with the MTA Agreement, provided that gross revenues in such year (i) were at least equal to the gross revenues generated in the Recoupment Year, and (ii) did not decline by more than 5% from the prior year.
•
Term
. In July 2021, we extended the initial 10-year term of the MTA Agreement to a 13-year base term (the “Amended Term”). We have the option to extend the Amended Term for an additional five-year period at the end of the Amended Term, subject to satisfying certain quantitative and qualitative conditions.
We may utilize cash on hand and/or incremental third-party financing to fund equipment deployment costs over the next couple of years. However, we cannot reasonably estimate the aggregate financing amount, if any, at this time. As of March 31, 2025, we have issued surety bonds in favor of the MTA totaling approximately $136.0 million, which amount is subject to change as equipment installations are completed and revenues are generated. We incurred $3.7 million related to MTA equipment deployment costs in the three months ended March 31, 2025 (which includes equipment deployment costs related to future deployments), for a total of $612.6 million to date, of which $33.9 million had been recouped from incremental revenues to

Table of Contents
date. As of March 31, 2025, we had
Intangible assets
related to franchise agreements balance related to the MTA Agreement of $13.9 million. As of March 31, 2025, 27,033 digital displays had been installed, composed of 4,998 digital advertising screens on subway and train platforms and entrances, 15,664 smaller-format digital advertising screens on rolling stock and 6,371 MTA communications displays. In the three months ended March 31, 2025, 788 installations occurred.
As a result of negative aggregate undiscounted cash flow forecasts related to our MTA asset group, we performed a quarterly impairment analysis on the MTA asset group during the three months ended March 31, 2024, and recorded an impairment charge of $9.1 million for the quarter. The impairment charge recorded during 2024 represented additional MTA equipment deployment cost spending during the three months ended March 31, 2024. No impairment charges were recorded during the three months ended March 31, 2025. We currently expect positive aggregate cash flows on an undiscounted basis through to the end of the Amended Term of the MTA Agreement. If our MTA performance continues to be in line with, or better than, our current model, we would not expect to incur additional impairment charges on our MTA equipment deployment cost spending. There can be no assurance that these estimates and assumptions will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future, and a downward revision of these estimates and/or assumptions would decrease our cash flows, which could result in additional impairment charges in the future.
On May 8, 2025, we announced that our board of directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.30 per share on our common stock payable on June 30, 2025, to stockholders of record at the close of business on June 6, 2025.

Term Loan
The interest rate on the term loan due in 2026 (the “Term Loan”) was 6.1% per annum as of March 31, 2025. As of March 31, 2025, a discount of $0.4 million on the Term Loan remains unamortized. The discount is being amortized through
Interest expense, net
, on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.
Revolving Credit Facility
We also have a $500.0 million revolving credit facility, which matures in 2028 (the “Revolving Credit Facility,” together with the Term Loan, the “Senior Credit Facilities”).
As of March 31, 2025, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.
The commitment fee based on the amount of unused commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility was $0.5 million in each of the three months ended March 31, 2025, and 2024. As of March 31, 2025, we had issued letters of credit totaling approximately $5.2 million against the letter of credit facility sublimit under the Revolving Credit Facility.
Standalone Letter of Credit Facilities
As of March 31, 2025, we had issued letters of credit totaling approximately $64.7 million under our aggregate $81.0 million standalone letter of credit facilities. The total fees under the letter of credit facilities were immaterial in each of the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024.
Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility
As of March 31, 2025, we have a $150.0 million revolving accounts receivable securitization facility (the “AR Facility”), which terminates in June 2027, unless further extended.
In connection with the AR Facility, Outfront Media LLC and Outfront Media Outernet Inc., each a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and certain of the Company’s taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRSs”) (the “Originators”), will sell and/or contribute their respective existing and future accounts receivable and certain related assets to either Outfront Media Receivables LLC, a special purpose vehicle and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company relating to the Company’s qualified REIT subsidiary accounts receivable assets (the “QRS SPV”) or Outfront Media Receivables TRS, LLC a special purpose vehicle and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company relating to the Company’s TRS accounts receivable assets (the “TRS SPV” and together with the QRS SPV, the “SPVs”). The SPVs may transfer undivided interests in their respective accounts receivable assets to certain purchasers from time to time (the “Purchasers”). The SPVs are separate legal entities with their own separate creditors who will be entitled to access the SPVs’ assets before the assets become available to the Company. Accordingly, the SPVs’ assets are not available to pay creditors of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, although collections from the receivables in excess of amounts required to repay the Purchasers and other creditors of the SPVs may be remitted to the Company. Outfront Media LLC will service the accounts receivables on behalf of the SPVs for a fee. The Company has agreed to guarantee the performance of the Originators and Outfront Media LLC, in its capacity as servicer, of their respective obligations under the agreements governing the AR Facility. Neither the Company, the Originators nor the SPVs guarantee the collectability of the receivables under the AR Facility. Further, the TRS SPV and the QRS SPV are jointly and severally liable for their respective obligations under the agreements governing the AR Facility.
As of March 31, 2025, there were $50.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the AR Facility, at a borrowing rate of 5.6%. As of March 31, 2025, borrowing capacity remaining under the AR Facility was $100.0 million based on approximately $312.9 million of accounts receivable that could be used as collateral for the AR Facility in accordance with the agreements governing the AR Facility. The commitment fee based on the amount of unused commitments under the AR Facility was $0.1 million in each of the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024. In April 2025, we made a repayment of $10.0 million under the AR Facility.
Debt Covenants
Our credit agreement, dated as of January 31, 2014 (as amended, restated, amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise modified, the “Credit Agreement”), governing the Senior Credit Facilities, the agreements governing the AR Facility, and the indentures governing our senior notes contain customary affirmative and negative covenants, subject to certain exceptions, including but not limited to those that restrict the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ abilities to (i) pay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect to the Company’s or its wholly-owned subsidiary, Outfront Media Capital LLC’s capital stock or
42
Table of Contents
make other restricted payments other than dividends or distributions necessary for us to maintain our REIT status, subject to certain conditions and exceptions, (ii) enter into agreements restricting certain subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany or third-party transfers, and (iii) incur additional indebtedness. One of the exceptions to the restriction on our ability to incur additional indebtedness is satisfaction of a Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio, which is the ratio of our consolidated total debt to our Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) for the trailing four consecutive quarters, of no greater than 6.0 to 1.0. As of March 31, 2025, our Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio was 4.8 to 1.0, as adjusted to give pro forma effect to the Transaction, in accordance with the Credit Agreement.
The terms of the Credit Agreement (and under certain circumstances, the agreements governing the AR Facility) require that we maintain a Consolidated Net Secured Leverage Ratio, which is the ratio of (i) our consolidated secured debt (less up to $150.0 million of unrestricted cash) to (ii) our Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) for the trailing four consecutive quarters, of no greater than 4.5 to 1.0. As of March 31, 2025, our Consolidated Net Secured Leverage Ratio was 1.6 to 1.0, as adjusted to give pro forma effect to the Transaction, in accordance with the Credit Agreement. As of March 31, 2025, we are in compliance with our debt covenants.
Deferred Financing Costs
As of March 31, 2025, we had deferred $19.6 million in fees and expenses associated with the Term Loan, the Revolving Credit Facility, the AR Facility and our senior notes. We are amortizing the deferred fees through
Interest expense, net,
on our Consolidated Statement of Operations over the respective terms of the Term Loan, Revolving Credit Facility, AR Facility and our senior notes.
Equity
At-the-Market Equity Offering Program
We have a sales agreement in connection with an “at-the-market” equity offering program (the “ATM Program”), under which we may, from time to time, issue and sell shares of our common stock up to an aggregate offering price of $300.0 million. We have no obligation to sell any of our common stock under the sales agreement and may at any time suspend solicitations and offers under the sales agreement. No shares were sold under the ATM Program during the three months ended March 31, 2025. As of March 31, 2025, we had approximately $232.5 million of capacity remaining under the ATM Program.
Series A Preferred Stock Issuance
On April 20, 2020, we issued 400,000 shares of our Series A Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock (the “Series A Preferred Stock”), par value $0.01 per share. The Series A Preferred Stock ranks senior to the shares of the Company’s common stock with respect to dividend and distribution rights. Holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to a cumulative dividend accruing at the initial rate of 7.0% per year, payable quarterly in arrears, subject to increases as set forth in the Articles Suppleme
