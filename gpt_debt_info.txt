Basis of Presentation and New Accounting Standards
Unless the context otherwise requires, all references herein to the “Company,” “Ingredion,” “we,” “us,” and “our” shall mean Ingredion Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries. These statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those statements contained in Ingredion’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. The significant accounting policies and estimates used in preparing these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements were applied on the same basis and consistent with those reflected in Ingredion’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024.
The unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of March 31, 2025 and for the first quarter of March 31, 2025 and 2024 included herein were prepared by us on the same basis as our audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2024 and reflect all adjustments (consisting solely of normal recurring items unless otherwise noted) that are, in our opinion, necessary for the fair presentation of the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income, Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, Condensed Consolidated Statements of Equity and Redeemable Equity, and Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The results for the interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full year or any other future period.
New Accounting Standards
In August 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU No. 2023-05,
Business Combinations - Joint Venture Formations (Subtopic 805-60).
This ASU requires that a joint venture apply a new basis of accounting upon formation. By applying a new basis of accounting, a joint venture, upon formation, will recognize and initially measure its assets and liabilities at fair value (with exceptions to fair value measurement that are consistent with the business combinations guidance). This ASU is effective prospectively for all joint venture formations with a formation date on or after January 1, 2025. A joint venture that was formed before January 1, 2025 may elect to apply the amendments retrospectively. We adopted this ASU at the beginning of our 2025 fiscal year on a prospective basis.
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09,
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
. This ASU requires public business entities on an annual basis to disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation and provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. Additionally, this ASU requires information pertaining to taxes paid (net of refunds received) to be disaggregated by federal, state, and foreign taxes with further disaggregation for specific jurisdictions to the extent the related amounts exceed a quantitative threshold. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. We are currently assessing the impact of this ASU on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03,
Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosure (Subtopic 220-40)
. The amendments in this update enhance disclosures about a public business entity’s expenses and provide more detailed information about the types of expenses included in certain notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2026, with early adoption permitted. We are currently assessing the impact of this ASU on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

On February 1, 2024, we completed the sale of our South Korea business, which we reported in All Other, for a total consideration of

330
billion South Korean won, or $
247
million net of certain transaction costs. During the first quarter of 2025, we received the first annual consideration payment of
18
billion South Korean won, or

Fair Value Measurements
We measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value, which is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the “exit price”) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In determining fair value, we use various valuation approaches. The hierarchy of those valuation approaches is in three levels based on the reliability of inputs. Assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Below is a summary of the hierarchy levels:
•
Level 1 inputs consist of quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
•
Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. Level 2 inputs are based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data.
•
Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs are used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date.
