CREDIT FACILITIES SECTION (KEY REVOLVER/TERM LOAN INFO):

Credit Facilities
As of March 31, 2025, we have total outstanding debt of $2.1 billion and a revolving credit facility that provides for up to $900.0 million of backup liquidity to finance working capital needs, refinance or reduce existing indebtedness, and for general corporate use. In addition, the facility provides for an uncommitted incremental facility whereby, under certain circumstances, we may, at our option, increase the amount of the revolving facility or incur term loans in an aggregate amount not to exceed $400 million. As of March 31, 2025, we
were in compliance with all covenants of our debt agreements.
For a summary of the fair and carrying values of our outstanding debt as of March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, refer to
Note 15, Debt and Note 16, Fair Value of Financial Instruments
to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report. For additional information on our outstanding debt and credit facility refer to

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK
Information concerning market risk is contained in Item 7A “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. As of March 31, 2025, there were no material changes in our exposure to market risk from December 31, 2024 other than the following:
Tariff Risks
During the first quarter of 2025, various tariffs were announced on imports into the U.S. On April 2, 2025, the U.S. announced a new universal baseline tariff of 10%, plus significant additional country-specific tariffs for select trading partners, on all U.S. imports. The reciprocal country-specific tariffs were subsequently paused for 90 days on most countries. The imposition of the baseline 10% tariff will increase our costs of goods sold. We are conducting an internal review and are assessing how the increased reciprocal tariffs may affect operating profitability, business operations, and strategies to mitigate potential cost increases.
ITEM 4.
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
We have established disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act)) that are designed to ensure that material information relating to us, including our consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to our Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer) by others within our organization. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2025. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2025.
Management concluded that the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q fairly state, in all material respects, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with GAAP.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES SECTION:

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Cash flows
We anticipate that our existing cash and credit facilities will be sufficient to support our operating and investing needs for at least the next twelve months. Our future cash requirements could be affected by acquisitions that we may complete, purchases of our common stock or the payment of dividends in the future. Historically, we have used the liquidity generated from cash flow from operations, debt financings and issuances of common stock to finance our growth and operating needs. In the future, there are no assurances that we will continue to generate cash flow from operations or that additional financing alternatives will be available to us, if required, or, if available, will be obtained on terms favorable to us.
We aggregate all bank accounts that are subject to our notional cash pooling arrangement into a single balance on our consolidated balance sheets. Our notional cash pooling arrangement is managed by a third-party financial institution and as of March 31, 2025, it was in a positive position. The cash and cash equivalent balance held outside of the United States in our foreign subsidiaries was primarily located in the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Hong Kong.

The following table presents our cash flows from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities for the periods presented (in millions):

(148.3
)
Net cash provided by operating activities during the three months ended March 31, 2025, resulted primarily from consolidated net income adjusted for non-cash items of $55.7 million, and a change in operating assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions of $9.3 million. Net cash provided by operating activities during the three months ended March 31, 2024, resulted primarily from net income adjusted for non-cash items of $85.2 million, partially offset by a change in operating assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions and divestitures of $63.4 million.
The decrease in consolidated net income adjusted for non-cash items was primarily due to lower income as result of unfavorable margin mix and increased costs related to 2024 acquisitions.
In the first quarter of 2025, the change in operating assets and liabilities was not significant in the context of our working capital. In the first quarter of 2024, the net decrease in operating assets and liabilities was primarily attributable to an increase in inventory balances.
Net cash used in investing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2025, resulted primarily from purchases of property, plant and equipment of $26.0 million. Net cash used in investing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2024, resulted primarily from acquisitions of $274.5 million, purchases of property, plant and equipment of $21.4 million, and minority investments of $10.0 million.
Net cash used in financing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2025, was primarily from net repayments of our revolving line of credit of $28.0 million, repayments of long-term debt of $7.7 million, and cash paid for purchases of common stock under our repurchase program of $10.0 million, offset by proceeds from long-term debt of $2.9 million. Net cash provided by financing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2024, was primarily from cash received from the revolving line of credit of $268.9 million, offset by cash paid for repayment of the 2012 Note Purchase Agreement of $100.0 million, repayment of long term debt of $3.4 million, and dividend payments of $7.3 million.
Share Repurchase Program
During the three months ended March 31, 2025, the Company purchased a total of 200,731 shares at an aggregate cost of $10.0 million under the 2023 Repurchase Program. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company did not purchase any shares under the 2023 Repurchase Program. Refer to
Note 21, Shareholder's Equity,
