Our primary liquidity needs are to support working capital requirements in our business, funding recently declared and any future dividends, funding capital expenditures and inventory purchases,  continuing investment in upgrading and expanding our technological capabilities specifically related to additional functionality and enhanced navigation of our new web platform, continuing investment in sales, marketing, merchandising, customer service and upgrading our distribution footprint and funding acquisitions.  We rely upon operating cash flow and our credit facility to meet these needs.  We currently believe that current cash on hand, cash flow from operations and our availability under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our working capital and other cash requirements for at least the next twelve months. We believe our current capital structure and cash resources are adequate for our internal growth initiatives. To the extent our growth initiatives expand, including major acquisitions, we would seek to raise additional capital. We believe that, if needed, we can access public or private funding alternatives to raise additional capital.
Our working capital increased $8.3 million primarily related to inventory balances as we purchased summer seasonal products earlier in the year and increased accounts receivable balances. These increases were offset by increased accounts payable balances, accrued expenses and other current liabilities balances and reduced cash and cash equivalents, prepaid expenses and other current assets balances. Accounts receivable days outstanding were 38.4 in 2025 compared to 37.4 in 2024, inventory turns were 5.0 in 2025 compared to 5.5 in 2024 and accounts payable days outstanding were 48.9 in 2025 compared to 48.8 in 2024.  We expect that future accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable balances will fluctuate with net sales and the product mix of our net sales.

Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $3.3 million in 2025 compared to $6.3 million provided in 2024, attributable to changes in our working capital accounts which used $14.6 million in cash compared to $10.7 million used in 2024, primarily the result of the changes in accounts receivable, accounts payable, inventory and accrued expenses, other current liabilities and other liabilities balances. Cash generated from net income adjusted by other non-cash items, provided $17.9 million in 2025 compared to $17.0 million provided by these items in 2024 primarily due to increased stock-based compensation expense generated in the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to 2024.  Net cash provided by operating activities from discontinued operations was $0.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024.
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities in 2025 totaled $0.2 million used for warehouse machinery and equipment for distribution facilities, computer equipment upgrades and molds. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $1.3 million in 2024 was used for warehouse machinery and equipment for distribution facilities, leasehold improvements, and computer equipment upgrades.
Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities totaled $8.8 million in 2025 primarily related to the regular quarterly dividends of $0.26 per common share which totaled approximately $10.1 million. Offsetting these payments were proceeds of $1.2 million from the issuance of common stock from stock option exercises, offset by payments for payroll taxes through shares withheld, which totaled $0.7 million and proceeds of $0.8 million from the issuance of common stock from our employee stock purchase plan. In 2024, net cash used in financing activities totaled $9.6 million primarily related to the regular quarterly dividends of $0.25 per common share which totaled approximately $9.6 million. Offsetting these payments were proceeds of $0.8 million from the issuance of common stock from our employee stock purchase plan and proceeds of $0.7 million from the issuance of common stock from stock option exercises, offset by payments for payroll taxes through shares withheld which totaled $1.5 million.
The Company maintains a $125.0 million secured revolving credit facility with one financial institution, which has a five year term, maturing on October 19, 2026 and provides for borrowings in the United States. The credit agreement contains certain operating, financial and other covenants, including limits on annual levels of capital expenditures, availability tests related to payments of dividends and stock repurchases and fixed charge coverage tests related to acquisitions.  The revolving credit agreement requires that a minimum level of availability be maintained.  If such availability is not maintained, the Company will be required to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined).  The borrowings under the agreement are subject to borrowing base limitations of up to 85% of eligible accounts receivable and the inventory advance rate computed as the lesser of 65% or 85% of the net orderly liquidation value (“NOLV”).  Borrowings are secured by substantially all of the Borrower’s assets, as defined, including all accounts, accounts receivable, inventory and certain other assets, subject to limited exceptions, including the exclusion of certain foreign assets from the collateral.  The interest rate under the amended and restated facility is computed at applicable market rates based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”), the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (“NYFRB”) or the Prime Rate, plus an applicable margin.  The applicable margin varies based on borrowing base availability.  As of March 31, 2025, eligible collateral under the credit agreement was $125.0 million, total availability was approximately $122.2 million, total outstanding letters of credit was $1.7 million, and total excess availability was $120.5 million. The Company was in compliance with all of the covenants of the credit agreement as of March 31, 2025.
Levels of earnings and cash flows are dependent on factors such as consolidated gross margin and selling, distribution and administrative costs, product mix and relative levels of domestic and foreign sales.  Unusual gains or expense items, such as special (gains) charges and settlements, may impact earnings and are separately disclosed.  We expect that past performance may not be indicative of future performance due to the competitive nature of our business where the need to adjust prices to gain or hold market share is prevalent.
Macroeconomic conditions, such as business and consumer sentiment, may affect our revenues, cash flows or financial condition.  However, we do not believe that there is a direct correlation between any specific macroeconomic indicator and our revenues, cash flows or financial condition. We are not currently interest rate sensitive, as we have no outstanding debt.
The expenses and capital expenditures described above will require significant levels of liquidity, which we believe can be adequately funded from our currently available cash resources, cash flow from operations and borrowing under our current credit facility.  In 2025 we anticipate capital expenditures in the range of $2.0 to $3.0 million, though at this time we are not contractually committed to incur these expenditures.

In the past we have engaged in opportunistic acquisitions, choosing to pay the purchase price in cash, and may do so in the future as favorable situations arise.  However, a deep and prolonged period of reduced business spending could adversely impact our cash resources and force us to either forego future acquisition opportunities or to pay the purchase price using stock, debt or a combination of consideration which could have an adverse effect on our earnings. We believe that our cash balances and future cash flows from operations and availability under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our working capital and other cash requirements for at least the next twelve months.
We maintain our cash and cash equivalents in money market funds or their equivalents that have maturities of less than three months and in non-interest bearing accounts that partially offset banking fees. As of March 31, 2025, we had no investments with maturities of greater than three months.   Accordingly, we do not believe that our cash balances have significant exposure to interest rate risk.  At March 31, 2025 cash balances held in foreign subsidiaries totaled approximately $3.1 million. These balances are held in local country banks and are held primarily to support local working capital needs. The Company had over $156 million of liquidity (cash and undrawn line of credit) in the U.S. as of March 31, 2025.
Material Cash Requirements
We are obligated under non-cancelable operating and finance leases for the rental of our facilities and certain of our equipment which expires at various dates through 2034.  As of March 31, 2025 we were obligated for approximately $80.2 million under these non-cancelable leases. In 2025 we anticipate remaining cash expenditures of approximately $13.7 million for these operating leases. We have sublease agreements for unused space, as well as excess space in facilities we are currently occupying in the United States and Canada. In the event the sub lessee is unable to fulfill its obligations, we wou
