Business/technology acquired
Substantially all of the assets and rights associated with the business of NanoString Technologies including the equity interests of the six subsidiaries (collectively, “NanoString”). The Company also assumed certain of its liabilities, including potential liabilities associated with ongoing litigations. Included in the liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date is $
44.7
M determined in accordance with ASC Topic 450. Refer to Note 20, Commitments and Contingencies for more details on these litigations.
Outstanding share capital of TecInvest S.à r.l, Eliman 1 S.à r.l,, and Eliman 2 S.à r.l, and their
100
% interests in 18 subsidiaries (collectively “ELITech” or “ELITech Group”).
Outstanding share capital of Chemspeed Technologies AG and its three wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively “Chemspeed”).
In the acquisitions above, customer relationships and technology intangible assets were the most significant identifiable assets acquired. The fair value of the intangible assets is estimated using a multi-period excess earnings method for customer relationships and a relief from royalty method for technology. For the acquisition of ELITechGroup, the cash flow projections for the customer relationships included significant judgments and assumptions related to customer attrition rates, contributory asset charges, and discount rates and the cash flow projections for the technology included significant judgments and assumptions related to revenue growth rates, royalty rates, obsolescence rates and discount rates.

The Company expects to amortize backlog through the first quarter of 2026.
The Company believes goodwill to represent future economic benefits of the acquisitions that are not individually identifiable, primarily expected synergies from combining the businesses such as the elimination of surplus facilities and headcount, and the utilization of the Company’s existing commercial infrastructure to expand sales of the acquired businesses’ products and services. The Company does not expect the amounts allocated to goodwill for ELITechGroup or Chemspeed to be deductible for tax purposes. The Company expects the amounts allocated to goodwill for NanoString to be deductible for tax purposes.
In
the first quarter of 2025, the Company finalized its determination of the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed for the Chemspeed acquisition. The Company recorded the provisional determination of the fair value of the
11
Table of Contents
identifiable
assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the information available as of the closing of the acquisition for the NanoString and ELITechGroup acquisitions. For NanoString, the Company recorded certain measurement period adjustments relating to the provisional amounts recorded for intangible assets and goodwill relating to updates to the Company’s valuation and other assumptions in the first quarter of 2025 and the fourth quarter of 2024. The related impact to the consolidated statements of operations that would have been recognized in previous periods if the adjustments were recognized as of the acquisition date was a reduction of $
0.6
million in amortization expense recorded during the first quarter of 2025.
The final fair value of the net assets acquired may result in adjustments to these assets and liabilities, including goodwill.
Other 2024 Acquisitions
During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company acquired other businesses which were accounted for under the acquisition method that complemented the Company’s existing product offerings.

The Company has finalized its valuation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed related to the Spectral Instruments Imaging LLC and Nion, LLC acquisitions within the measurement period, and no further adjustments will be made.
Results of operations for 2024 acquired businesses
Results from the acquisitions included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company from the acquisition dates through December 31, 2024 include revenues of $
259.5
million and pre-tax losses totaling $
108.0
million. Pre-tax losses include purchased intangible amortization and step up inventory costs rela
ted to the acquisitions as well as acquisition-related expenses, which are recorded within “Other charges, net” in the consolidated statements of operations. Acquisition-related expenses primarily relate to pre-close services, legal and professional services associated with integration activities, and other transaction costs. The tax effect of pre-tax losses incurred will be included in the related jurisdictional tax returns of its subsidiaries.
Supplemental Pro Forma Information

The revenue and net income (loss) results for all 2024 acquisitions are included in the consolidated financial statements for the three months ended, March 31, 2025.
NanoString was unable to file its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, following NanoString and certain of its subsidiaries filing voluntary petitions under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware on February 4, 2024.  Further, management considers that results of NanoString for the period from October 1, 2023, through May 6, 2024, are unlikely to be meaningful to users of these financial statements given the operations and financial results of NanoString were inherently materially impacted by the bankruptcy declaration. Accordingly, the pro forma financial information does not include the results of NanoString from January 1, 2024, through its acquisition date of May 6, 2024, as the historical financial statements after the quarter ended September 30, 2023 are not meaningful.
The pro forma adjustments that could impact the Company's consolidated net income include the following (in millions):
December 31, 2024
Net increase in amortization and depreciation expense associated with tangible and intangible assets

The supplemental pro forma financial information presented above is for illustrative purposes only and does not include the pro forma adjustments that would be required under Article 11 of Regulation S-X for pro forma financial information. This supplemental pro forma financial information is not necessarily indicative of the financial position or results of operations that would have been realized if the NanoString, ELITechGroup and Chemspeed acquisitions had been completed on January 1, 2024. No effect has been given for synergies, if any, that may have been achieved through the acquisitions nor is it indicative of future operating results or financial position. The pro forma adjustments are based upon currently available information and certain assumptions that the Company believes are reasonable under the circumstances.

On July 31, 2024, the Company acquired a minority equity interest in NovAliX a preclinical contract research organization specializing in expert drug discovery services, headquartered in Strasbourg, France. The Company obtained a
30
% interest in NovAliX’s common stock in exchange for consideration of EUR
31.5
million (approximately $
34.1
million). The Company accounts for its investment in NovAliX using the equity-method of accounting. Concurrent with the transaction, the Company entered into an agreement with the remaining shareholders that provides the Company with the right to purchase, and the shareholders with the right to sell, the remaining ownership of NovAliX for cash at a contractually defined redemption value exercisable beginning in 2029 and ending in 2034. The Company recognized a liability, classified in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet, related to the potential obligation to acquire the remaining equity interests if the purchase option is exercised, estimated at EUR
14.4
million (approximately $
16.0
million) using the discounted cash flow method.

b)
Bruker’s mix of remaining performance obligations, or backlog, consists of firm orders under non-cancelable purchase orders received from customers and the timing of revenue recognition can vary significantly due to a variety of factors. Bruker manufactures innovative scientific instruments and diagnostic solutions which can result in varying production and installation timing due to components, customization, manufacturing, assembly, testing processes, and customer site availability or readiness. Bruker’
s expected completion of performance obligation can vary from year to year based on these and other factors. As a result, backlog on any particular date can be indicative of Bruker’s
short-term revenue performance but is not necessarily a reliable indicator of long-term revenue performance. The Company will recognize revenues for these performance obligations as they are satisfied, the majority of which is expected to occur within the next twelve months.
Lease Revenue
The Company’s right to future consideration from reagent purchases under the reagent agreements is allocated to instrument revenue and is recorded as a lease receivable within other current and long-term assets. Agreements that do not meet the criteria to be classified as a sales-type lease are classified as operating leases. Lease revenue is presented in product revenue in the consolidated statements of operations and consisted of less than
2
% of total consolidated revenue in each of the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024 respectively.

Business Segment Information
The Company's
CEO
is the chief operating decision maker. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. We exclude from segment expenses and segment operating income (loss) certain corporate-related expenses and certain transactions or adjustments, such as costs related to restructuring actions, acquisition and related integration expenses, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and costs associated with our global information technology transition initiatives. The Company's intersegment sales and transfers are accounted for at discounted market-based prices based on intersegment agreements.
The chief operating decision maker uses segment operating income (loss) to assess the performance for each segment by comparing the results of each segment with one another, comparing actual results to budget and prior year, as well as to allocate resources.

The Company files tax returns in the United States, which include federal, state and local jurisdictions, and many foreign jurisdictions with varying statutes of limitations. The Company considers Germany, the United States and Switzerland to be its significant tax jurisdictions. The majority of the Company’s earnings are derived in Germany and Switzerland. Accounting for the various federal and local taxing authorities, the statutory rates for 2025 are approximately
30.0
% and
20.0
% for Germany and Switzerland, respectively. The mix of earnings in those two jurisdictions resulted in an increase of approximately
5.7
% from the U.S. statutory rate of
21.0
% in the three months ended March 31, 2025.
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development introduced its Pillar Two Framework Model Rules (“Pillar 2”), which provides guidance for a global minimum tax. Various countries have either enacted or are in the process of enacting legislation to implement this framework. Our income tax provision for the three months ended March 31, 2025, reflects currently enacted legislation and guidance related to the model rules. This enacted legislation and guidance had an impact on our income tax provision, resulting in an increase to the Company’s effective tax rate of
2.1
% for the three months ended March 31, 2025. The Company continues to monitor the countries in which it operates as they enact legislation implementing Pillar 2.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Instruments
The Company's major exposures relate to foreign exchange rate, interest rate and commodity price risks.  Risk management activities related to these risks are as follows:
Foreign Exchange Rate Risk:
The Company’s exposure to foreign exchange rate risk includes exchange risk as a result of non-U.S. operations having functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which is managed by cross-currency interest rate swap agreements and long-term debt designated as net investment hedges. As of March 31, 2025, the Company had several cross-currency interest rate swap agreements that qualify for hedge accounting with a notional value of
$
129.8
million of U.S. Dollar to Swiss Franc and a notional value of
$
129.8
million of U.S. Dollar to Euro to hedge the variability in the movement of foreign currency exchange rates on portions of our Euro and Swiss Franc denominated net asset investments.
In addition, the Company has foreign currency exposure at a transaction level, and this is addressed by forward currency contracts for significant exposures, which have not been designated as accounting hedges.
Interest Rate Risk:
The Company’s exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to outstanding variable rate debt under the U.S. dollar denominated 2019 Term Loan and adverse movements in the related market rates. This exposure is managed as part of a cross-currency interest rate swap which involves the Company paying-fixed receiving-floating. The objective of this designated cash flow hedge is to offset the variability of cash flows on term loan debt interest payments attributable to changes in SOFR, a contractually specified rate. The difference between the interest rate received and paid under the interest rate and cross-currency swap agreements is recorded in Interest and other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.
Commodity Price Risk:
The Company has arrangements with certain customers under which it has a firm commitment to deliver copper-based superconductors at a fixed price. In order to minimize the volatility that fluctuations in the price of copper have on the Company’s sales of these commodities, the Company enters into commodity hedge contracts. As commodity contracts settle, gains (losses) related to changes in fair values are included within revenues.
The Company had the following notional amounts outstanding under foreign exchange contracts, cross-currency interest rate swap agreements and long-term debt designated as net investment hedges and the respective fair value of the instruments recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as follows (in millions):

Commitments and Contingencies
In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 450, Contingencies, the Company accrues anticipated costs of settlement, damages or other costs to the extent specific losses are probable and reasonably estimable. These accruals are adjusted periodically as assessments change or additional information becomes available.
Litigation and Related Contingencies
The Company’s product offerings include technology that is either developed or acquired, and these intellectual property rights, particularly patents, are a significant part of ongoing product development and differentiation. Lawsuits, claims and proceedings of a nature that claim infringement on patent licenses owned by others are considered normal to the business and may be pending from time to time against the Company. Intellectual property litigation is inherently complex and unpredictable. Although monetary and injunctive relief is typically sought, remedies and restitution are generally not determined until the conclusion of the trial court proceedings and can be modified on appeal. Accordingly, the outcomes of individual cases are difficult to time, predict or quantify.
Loss contingency provisions are recorded if the potential loss from any claim, asserted or unasserted, or legal proceeding related to patents, products and other matters, is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, or a range of loss can be determined. If the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely, management’s best estimate is represented by the minimum amount of the range. Disclosure is provided when a loss is considered probable, but the loss is not reasonably estimable and when a material loss is reasonably possible but not probable. The outcome of any of these proceedings cannot be accurately predicted, and the ultimate resolution of any of these existing matters, net of amounts accrued in the Company's balance sheet, may have a material adverse effect on the Company's business or financial condition.
Third parties might allege that the Company or its collaborators are infringing their patent rights or that the Company is otherwise violating their intellectual property rights. An adverse outcome in any of these proceedings could result in one or more of the following and have material impact on our business or consolidated results of operations and financial position: (i) loss of patent protection; (ii) inability to continue to engage in certain activities; (iii) payment of significant damages, royalties, penalties and/or license fees to third parties; and, (iv) with respect to products acquired through acquisitions accounted for as business combinations, potentially significant intangible asset impairment charges.
At March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, the accrual for several legal matters that are probable and estimable was
$
96.4
million and $
86.0
million, respectively.
In management’s opinion, the Company is not currently involved in any legal proceedings other than those specifically identified below, individually or in the aggregate, that could materially adversely impact our operating results and cash flows. Unless included in our legal accrual or otherwise indicated below, a range of loss associated with any
27
Table of Contents
individual material legal proceeding cannot be reasonably estimated. While the Company believes it has meritorious defenses for the matters described below, the ultimate resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period.
In connection with the Company’s acquisition of PhenomeX Inc. (“PhenomeX”) on October 2, 2023, the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Bruker Cellular Analysis, Inc. (“BCA”), was substituted as a party into the existing patent litigation between PhenomeX and AbCellera Biologics Inc (“AbCellera”) related to PhenomeX’s Beacon instruments and Opto products. The University of British Columbia (“UBC”), the owner and licensor to AbCellera of the asserted patents, is a co-plaintiff in the litigation. The plaintiffs’ complaint seeks unspecified damages and injunctive relief.
In connection with the acquisition of NanoString on May 6, 2024, the Company assumed certain of its liabilities, including the liabilities associated with the litigation matters related to NanoString’s GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler products (the “GeoMx Matter”) and CosMx Spatial Molecular Imager products (the “CosMx Matter”). In the GeoMx Matter, in November 2023, a jury verdict in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware was entered in favor of the plaintiffs, 10x Genomics, Inc. (“10x”) and Prognosys Biosciences, Inc. (collectively, the “Plaintiffs”) awarding damages. On December 23, 2024, the Court issued an order upholding the jury’s damages award, plus interest and a damages true-up for GeoMx sales since the November 2023 verdict, while declining 10x’s request for enhanced damages and attorneys’ fees. The Court stated that it would grant 10x’s request for an injunction against GeoMx products in the United States, while noting that the proposed injunction would include a carve out for sales of consumables to the installed base of GeoMx customers. The Court has not yet issued a final judgment. Once a final judgment is issued, the Company intends to appeal the case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and to seek a stay of any injunction that is ordered while the case is being appealed. The CosMx Matter complaint concerns claims by 10x and the President and Fellows of Harvard College (“Harvard”) of patent infringement with respect to CosMx Spatial Molecular Imager products as well as counterclaims against 10x and Harvard for antitrust and unfair competition violations.  The CosMx Matter complaint seeks unspecified damages and injunctive relief.
In addition, the Company is subject to regulation by national, state and local government agencies in the United States and other countries in which it operates. From time to time, the Company is the subject of governmental investigations often involving regulatory, marketing and other business practices. These governmental investigations may result in the commencement of civil and criminal proceedings, fines, penalties and administrative remedies which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and/or liquidity.

no
t purchase any shares under the 2023 Repurchase Program.
In August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”) was signed into law in the United States. The IRA introduced new tax provisions, including a
1.0
% excise tax on stock repurchases. The Company expects additional guidance and regulations to be issued in future periods and will continue to assess its potential impact on its business as further information becomes available. The estimated excise tax on our stock repurchases was de minimis and was recorded in other current liabilities and additional paid in capital for the three months ended March 31, 2025.

ITEM 2.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included in Part 1, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024.
Any statements other than statements of historical fact contained in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may be deemed to be forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Without limiting the foregoing, the words “believe,” “anticipate,” “plan,” “expect,” “seek,” “may,” “will,” “intend,” “estimate,” “should” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.
Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding:
•
the impact of supply chain challenges on our business and operations;
•
our working capital requirements and the sufficiency of our cash, borrowings and proceeds of indebtedness to fund our operations and investment activities;
•
our plans to make capital investments;
•
the impact of changes to tax and accounting rules and changes in law;
•
fluctuations in estimates impacting costs related to our self-funded health insurance plan;
•
our expectations regarding backlog and revenue;
•
our expectations and the impact of our restructuring initiatives or success of our acquisitions;
•
the impact of our global IT transformation activities;
•
the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and changes in commodity prices; and
•
any other statements that address events or developments that the Company intends or believes will or may occur in the future.
Actual results may differ from those referred to in any forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the risks described in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 and in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We expressly disclaim any intent or obligation to update these forward-looking statements other than as required by law.
We can experience quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in our operating results as a result of various factors, some of which are outside our control, such as:
•
general economic conditions, including inflation, uncertainties caused by recent banking industry volatility, the threat of recession, financial liquidity, currency volatility or devaluation, supply chain or manufacturing capabilities, and uncertain economic conditions in the United States and abroad, and additional tariffs, including those imposed or that may be imposed by the new presidential administration in the U.S.;
•
geopolitical tensions, including those on our customers, such as the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and related economic sanctions, the conflict in the Middle East and surrounding areas, the possible expansion of such conflicts and potential geopolitical consequences, the ongoing tensions between the United States and China, tariff and trade policy changes, and increasing potential of conflict involving countries in Asia that are significant to the Company’s supply chain operations, such as Taiwan and China;
•
potential energy shortages in Europe where the Company has significant operations and overall higher energy and transportation costs;
•
the impacts of climate change and certain weather-related disruptions;
•
the timing of governmental stimulus programs and academic research budgets;
•
the time it takes between the date customer orders and deposits are received, systems are shipped and accepted by our customers and full payment is received;
30
Table of Contents
•
foreign currency exchange rates;
•
the worldwide shortage of semiconductor chips, components and raw materials, such as copper;
•
changes in raw material, component and logistics costs;
•
the time it takes for us to receive critical materials to manufacture our products;
•
the time it takes to satisfy local customs requirements and other export/import requirements;
•
the time it takes for customers to construct or prepare their facilities for our products;
•
the time required to obtain governmental licenses;
•
our ability to identify suitable acquisition targets and successfully integrate and manage acquired business; and
•
costs related to acquisitions of technology or businesses.
Several of these factors have in the past affected and may continue to affect the amount and timing of revenue recognized on sales of our products and receipt of related payments and will likely continue to do so in the future. Accordingly, our operating results in any particular quarter may not necessarily be an indication of any future quarter’s operating performance.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Uses and definitions:
Although our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, we believe that describing revenue excluding the effects of foreign currency, and expenses excluding costs related to restructuring actions, acquisition and related integration expenses, amortization of acquired intangible assets, costs associated with our global information technology transition initiatives, and other costs (“non-GAAP adjustments”), provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance but should not be considered in isolation from or as a replacement for the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. We rely internally on certain measures that are not calculated according to GAAP. These measures include constant exchange rate (“CER”) currency revenue growth, organic revenue growth, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, and free cash flow.
Our management believes that these financial measures provide relevant and useful information that is widely used by equity analysts, investors and competitors in our industry, as well as by our management, in assessing both consolidated and business unit performance and are useful measures to evaluate our continuing business. Additionally, management believes free cash flow is a useful measure to evaluate our business as it indicates the amount of cash generated after additions to property, plant, and equipment which is available for, among other things, investments in our business, acquisitions, share repurchases, dividends and repayment of debt.
We regularly use these non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage, and evaluate our business results and make operating decisions. We also measure our employees and compensate them, in part, based on such non-GAAP measures and use this information for our planning and forecasting activities. These measures may also be useful to investors in evaluating the underlying operating performance of our business. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, and it may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, and therefore, may not be comparable among companies.
We define our non-GAAP financial measures as follows:
•
CER currency revenue growth as GAAP revenue excluding the effect of changes in foreign currency translation rates.
•
Organic revenue growth as GAAP revenue excluding the effect of changes in foreign currency translation rates and acquisitions.
•
Non-GAAP gross profit as GAAP gross profit excluding certain non-GAAP adjustments.
•
Non-GAAP gross profit margin as GAAP gross profit margin excluding the impact of certain non-GAAP adjustments.
•
Non-GAAP operating income as GAAP operating income excluding non-GAAP adjustments.
•
Non-GAAP operating income margin as GAAP operating income margin excluding the impact of non-GAAP adjustments.
•
Free cash flow as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less additions to property, plant, and equipment.

Revenue increases, compared to the year ago quarter, were driven primarily by the impact of our 2024 acquisitions and by growing demand for our differentiated instruments and solutions. For the three months ended March 31, 2025, the BSI BioSpin Segment recorded significant revenue from the sale of one GHz-class NMR system, and growth from the Chemspeed acquisition. The increase in revenue in the BSI CALID Segment for the three months ended March 31, 2025, relates primarily to the ELITechGroup acquisition and modest revenue growth across industrial and biopharma segments. The BSI NANO Segment revenue increase for the three months ended March 31, 2025, was driven by the NanoString acquisition.

Table of Contents
Geographically in the three months ended March 31, 2025, our North American revenue grew 10.0%, compared to the year ago quarter, primarily from the ELITechGroup and NanoString acquisitions that occurred in the second quarter of 2024. In addition, Asia Pacific revenue increased by 4.4%, and European revenue increased by 16.5% compared to the same period in 2024, which were also driven primarily by 2024 acquisitions.

The increase in gross profit and slight decrease in gross profit margin, compared to the prior year quarter, were both driven primarily by the impact of the ELITechGroup and NanoString acquisitions that occurred in 2024.
Selling, General and Administrative
Our selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2025, increased to 28.1% of total revenue, from 27.1% of total revenue for the comparable period in 2024. The increase as a percentage of revenue was a result of increased spending related to additional headcount and personnel expenses from our 2024 acquisitions.
Research and Development
Our research and development expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2025, increased to 12.1% of total revenue from 11.3% of total revenue for the comparable period in 2024. The increase as a percentage of revenue is a result of our increased investment in research and development capabilities, and the mix of research and developments costs from 2024 acquisitions.
Other Charges, Net
Other charges, net for the three months ended March 31, 2025, increased to $36.9 million compared to $10.9 million for the comparable period in 2024. The year over year increase was primarily due to $18.6 million of acquisition-related litigation charges that primarily relate to the acquisitions of BCA and NanoString, $7.6 million of restructuring charges related primarily to restructuring programs as described in
Note 10, Restructuring and asset impairments,
as well as an increase of $2.1 million in acquisition-related expenses due to costs from 2024 acquisitions. Please refer to

The decrease in operating income was primarily due to the NanoString and Chemspeed acquisitions. The decrease in operating margin was primarily due to the ELITechGroup, NanoString, and Chemspeed acquisitions.
Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net
The increase in interest and other income (expense), net in the three months ended March 31, 2025, as compared to the same period in 2024 was primarily due to higher interest expense of $13.1 million due to increased borrowings.
Income Tax Provision
The effective tax rates for the three months ended March 31, 2025, and 2024 were 34.7% and 27.7%, respectively. The increase in the Company's effective tax rate was primarily due to changes in jurisdictional mix and net unfavorable discrete activities.
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development introduced its Pillar Two Framework Model Rules (“Pillar 2”), which provides guidance for a global minimum tax. Various countries have either enacted or are in the process of enacting legislation to implement this framework. Our income tax provision for the three months ended March 31, 2025, reflects currently enacted legislation and guidance related to the model rules. This enacted legislation and guidance had an impact on our income tax provision, resulting in an increase to the Company’s effective tax rate of 2.1% for the three months ended March 31, 2025. The Company continues to monitor the countries in which it operates as they enact legislation implementing Pillar 2.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Cash flows
We anticipate that our existing cash and credit facilities will be sufficient to support our operating and investing needs for at least the next twelve months. Our future cash requirements could be affected by acquisitions that we may complete, purchases of our common stock or the payment of dividends in the future. Historically, we have used the liquidity generated from cash flow from operations, debt financings and issuances of common stock to finance our growth and operating needs. In the future, there are no assurances that we will continue to generate cash flow from operations or that additional financing alternatives will be available to us, if required, or, if available, will be obtained on terms favorable to us.
We aggregate all bank accounts that are subject to our notional cash pooling arrangement into a single balance on our consolidated balance sheets. Our notional cash pooling arrangement is managed by a third-party financial institution and as of March 31, 2025, it was in a positive position. The cash and cash equivalent balance held outside of the United States in our foreign subsidiaries was primarily located in the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Hong Kong.

Net cash provided by operating activities during the three months ended March 31, 2025, resulted primarily from consolidated net income adjusted for non-cash items of $55.7 million, and a change in operating assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions of $9.3 million. Net cash provided by operating activities during the three months ended March 31, 2024, resulted primarily from net income adjusted for non-cash items of $85.2 million, partially offset by a change in operating assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions and divestitures of $63.4 million.
The decrease in consolidated net income adjusted for non-cash items was primarily due to lower income as result of unfavorable margin mix and increased costs related to 2024 acquisitions.
In the first quarter of 2025, the change in operating assets and liabilities was not significant in the context of our working capital. In the first quarter of 2024, the net decrease in operating assets and liabilities was primarily attributable to an increase in inventory balances.
Net cash used in investing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2025, resulted primarily from purchases of property, plant and equipment of $26.0 million. Net cash used in investing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2024, resulted primarily from acquisitions of $274.5 million, purchases of property, plant and equipment of $21.4 million, and minority investments of $10.0 million.
Net cash used in financing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2025, was primarily from net repayments of our revolving line of credit of $28.0 million, repayments of long-term debt of $7.7 million, and cash paid for purchases of common stock under our repurchase program of $10.0 million, offset by proceeds from long-term debt of $2.9 million. Net cash provided by financing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2024, was primarily from cash received from the revolving line of credit of $268.9 million, offset by cash paid for repayment of the 2012 Note Purchase Agreement of $100.0 million, repayment of long term debt of $3.4 million, and dividend payments of $7.3 million.
Share Repurchase Program
During the three months ended March 31, 2025, the Company purchased a total of 200,731 shares at an aggregate cost of $10.0 million under the 2023 Repurchase Program. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company did not purchase any shares under the 2023 Repurchase Program. Refer to
Note 21, Shareholder's Equity,
in the Notes to our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information on our share repurchase program.
Credit Facilities
As of March 31, 2025, we have total outstanding debt of $2.1 billion and a revolving credit facility that provides for up to $900.0 million of backup liquidity to finance working capital needs, refinance or reduce existing indebtedness, and for general corporate use. In addition, the facility provides for an uncommitted incremental facility whereby, under certain circumstances, we may, at our option, increase the amount of the revolving facility or incur term loans in an aggregate amount not to exceed $400 million. As of March 31, 2025, we
were in compliance with all covenants of our debt agreements.
For a summary of the fair and carrying values of our outstanding debt as of March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, refer to

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK
Information concerning market risk is contained in Item 7A “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. As of March 31, 2025, there were no material changes in our exposure to market risk from December 31, 2024 other than the following:
Tariff Risks
During the first quarter of 2025, various tariffs were announced on imports into the U.S. On April 2, 2025, the U.S. announced a new universal baseline tariff of 10%, plus significant additional country-specific tariffs for select trading partners, on all U.S. imports. The reciprocal country-specific tariffs were subsequently paused for 90 days on most countries. The imposition of the baseline 10% tariff will increase our costs of goods sold. We are conducting an internal review and are assessing how the increased reciprocal tariffs may affect operating profitability, business operations, and strategies to mitigate potential cost increases.
ITEM 4.
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
We have established disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act)) that are designed to ensure that material information relating to us, including our consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to our Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer) by others within our organization. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2025. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2025.
Management concluded that the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q fairly state, in all material respects, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with GAAP.
Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting
There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended March 31, 2025, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION
ITEM 1.
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
We are involved in lawsuits, claims, and proceedings, including, but not limited to, patent, customer, labor and employment and commercial matters, which arise in the ordinary course of business. As of March 31, 2025, other than as disclosed in
Note 20, Commitments and Contingencies

However, the outcome of any of these proceedings cannot be accurately predicted, and the ultimate resolution of any of these existing matters may have a material adverse effect on the Company's business or financial condition.
In addition, we are subject to regulation by national, state and local government agencies in the United States and other countries in which we operate. From time to time, we are the subject of governmental investigations often involving regulatory, marketing and other business practices.
